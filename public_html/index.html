    <h3>What is Ruby?</h3>
    <p>
      As described by the creator of Ruby, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, “Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex
      inside, just like our human body.” It can be described as a combination of Matsumoto’s favorite programming
      languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp). That being said, Ruby is an interpreted language. It is
      dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. As well, it supports multiple programming paradigms such as
      object-orientation, procedural, and functional programming. In fact, everything in Ruby is an object. This
      includes numbers and primitive types from other languages, in Ruby, there are no primitive types. Ruby is also
      seen as a very flexible language. For instance, if you wanted to add two numbers you could use the + operator or
      you could write a readable method that can do the same thing. One of the big selling points to this programming
      language is the well kept documentation. Almost everything you could ever need to know about Ruby is found on
      their website <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en">www.ruby-lang.org</a>.

    <h3>History of Ruby</h3>
    <p>
      The idea for the programming language known as Ruby was conceived in 1993 by Matz and another colleague. They were
      talking about possibly creating an object-oriented scripting language. A few years later in December of 1996, Ruby
      1.0 was released, followed by Ruby 1.1 in August of ‘97. These versions, however, were not stable enough to use,
      so a year later in December of ‘98, the first stable version was released, Ruby 1.2. Ths programming language was
      local to Japan, but has since been globalized. After working on the programming language for a few more years, a
      largely upgraded Ruby 1.8 was released in 2003, which included many changes to the original idea thought up by
      Matz 10 years prior. 4 years later from March to May 2007, Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby 1.8.7 were released. This has since
      been known as the ‘peak’ of Ruby, considering Mac OS X began shipping with this PL in the late 2007’s. Ruby 2.0
      was released in February 2013, and again brought many changes to the language to improve performance. The current
      version of Ruby is Ruby 3.0.1, which was released Apr 5, 2021.
