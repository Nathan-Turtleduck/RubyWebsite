    <tr>
      <td>You may program procedurally if you like (but it will still be object-oriented behind the scenes).</td>
      <td>You don’t need to compile your code. You just run it directly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Most of the operators are the same (including the compound assignment and also bitwise operators). Though, Ruby doesn’t have <code>&nbsp;++&nbsp;</code> or <code>&nbsp;--&nbsp;</code>.</td>
      <td>Objects are strongly typed (and variable names themselves have no type at all).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You’ve got <code>&nbsp;__FILE__&nbsp;</code> and <code>&nbsp;__LINE__&nbsp;</code>.</td>
      <td>There’s no macros or preprocessor. No casts. No pointers (nor pointer arithmetic). No typedefs, sizeof, nor enums.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You can also have constants, though there’s no special const keyword. Const-ness is enforced by a naming convention instead — names starting with a capital letter are for constants.</td>
      <td>There are no header files. You just define your functions (usually referred to as “methods”) and classes in the main source code files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Strings go in double-quotes.</td>
      <td>There’s no <code>&nbsp;#define&nbsp;</code>. Just use constants instead.</td>
    <tr>
      <td>Strings are mutable.</td>
    <td>All variables live on the heap. Further, you don’t need to free them yourself—the garbage collector takes care of that.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Just like man pages, you can read most docs in your terminal window—though using the ri command.</td>
      <td>Arguments to methods (i.e. functions) are passed by value, where the values are always object references.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>There’s no semicolons ending lines.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>The term “block” means something different. It’s for a block of code that you associate with a method call so the method body can call out to the block while it executes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>There are no variable declarations. You just assign to new names on-the-fly when you need them.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>When tested for truth, only false and nil evaluate to a false value. Everything else is true (including <code>&nbsp;0&nbsp;</code>, <code>&nbsp;0.0&nbsp;</code>, and <code>&nbsp;"0"&nbsp;</code>).</td>

        an object.

      <td>There’s a fairly large number of commonly-used built-ins.</td>
      <td>Although $ and @ are used as the first character in variable names sometimes, rather than indicating
        type, they indicate scope ($ for globals, @ for object instance, and @@ for class attributes).
      </td>

        any Ruby code you like inside that #{}).
      </td>
      <td>There’s no semicolons needed at the end of each line. Incidentally, you end things like function
        definitions, class definitions, and case statements with the end keyword.

        like a boolean.
