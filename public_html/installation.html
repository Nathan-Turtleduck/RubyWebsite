    <title>CS354 - LW1 : Team Perch : Ruby Installation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Ruby Installation</h3>
    There are several ways to install Ruby:
    UNIX-like OSs, using the package manager for your specific distribution is the easiest. Keeping in mind the packaged Ruby version may not be the newest one.
    Windows 10 (WSL) may be used to install a supported version of Ruby.
    Installers can be used to install a specific or multiple versions of Ruby; including a Windows installer.
    Managers help you to switch between Ruby versions on your system.
    Additionally, you may choose to build Ruby from source.

    <h4>Package Management Systems</h4>
    apt (Debian or Ubuntu)
    $ sudo apt-get install ruby-full

    yum (CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL)
    $ sudo yum install ruby

    snap (Ubuntu or other Linux distributions)
    The Snap package manager is developed by Canonical and provides the ability to switch between various channels.

    $ sudo snap install ruby --classic

    -- switching between channels --
    $ sudo snap switch ruby --channel=2.3/stable
    $ sudo snap refresh

    pacman (Arch Linux)
    $ sudo pacman -S ruby

    Homebrew (macOS)
    $ brew install ruby

    FreeBSD
    $ pkg install ruby

    (See documentation for more)

    <h4>Installers</h4>
    If the version of Ruby for your particular system is out of date, you may choose to use an installer; many support switching between versions.
    If you choose to use RVM as a version manager, no additional installer is required.

    ruby-build
    This is a plugin for rbenv which allows for compiling and installing multiple versions of Ruby. It is available for macOS, Linux, and other UNIX-like OSs.

    ruby-install
    Installer which allows compiling and installing multiplier versions of Ruby into arbitrary target directories. The complementary tool chruby allows users to switch between Ruby versions. Available for macOS, Linux, and other UNIX-like OSs.

    RubyInstaller
    Windows installer providing a full Ruby development environment.

    RubyStack
    If you intend to install Ruby to use Ruby on Rails, this installer provides a complete development environment and supports macOS, Linux, Windows, virtual machines, and cloud images.

    <h4>Managers</h4>
    Managers allow for ease or automatic switching between Ruby versions depending on project and other advantages, but are not officially supported.

    asdf-vm
    Extendable version manager supporting multiple languages.

    chruby
    Provides support for switching being Ruby versions installed by ruby-install or build from source.

    rbenv
    Manages multiple installations but lacks the ability to install Ruby itself.

    RVM (“Ruby Version Manager”)

    uru
    Lightweight, multi-platform command line tool which supports most OSs.

    <h4>Building from Source</h4>
    Finally, you can install Ruby from the source once downloaded and unpacked.

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

    The default install location for Ruby is /usr/local.
